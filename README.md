# Fitness Science Advisor

An evidence-based fitness guidance agent for Claude Code with integrations for popular fitness tracking platforms.

**Author:** [Marcin Konkel](https://marcinkonkel.com)

## Features

- **Evidence-Based Guidance**: Workout programming, nutrition science, body composition, and exercise physiology based on peer-reviewed research
- **Platform Integrations**: Connect to Hevy, Strava, Fitbit, Garmin, and Under Armour/MapMyFitness
- **`/fitness` Shortcut**: Quick access to the fitness advisor from anywhere in Claude Code
- **Myth Busting**: Get scientific analysis of fitness trends and claims
- **Personalized Context**: Remembers your goals, training history, and preferences across sessions
- **Body Composition Tracking**: Reads measurements from Tanita, InBody, or manual entries

## User Data Folder

On first startup, the agent automatically creates a folder structure in your home directory to store your personal fitness data:

```
~/fitness-advisor/
├── context.md          # Your personal context (goals, history, preferences)
├── data/               # Body composition measurements
│   ├── inbody-2024-01-15.pdf
│   ├── tanita-scan.jpg
│   └── measurements.txt
└── knowledge/          # Saved articles and debunked myths
    ├── debunked-cardio-kills-gains.md
    └── debunked-meal-timing.md
```

### Folder Purposes

| Folder/File | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `context.md` | Stores your training history, goals, preferences, and body composition trends. Updated automatically as you chat. |
| `data/` | Place your body composition reports here (PDFs, images, or text files from Tanita, InBody, or manual measurements). The agent reads these to track your progress. |
| `knowledge/` | When you ask about fitness myths, the agent offers to save the debunking as a reference file here. |

### Supported Measurement Formats

The agent can read body composition data from:
- **PDF reports** from InBody, Tanita, or similar bioimpedance analyzers
- **Images** (photos or screenshots of measurement printouts)
- **Text files** with manually entered data

Simply drop your measurement files into `~/fitness-advisor/data/` and the agent will parse them automatically.

## Security Notes

- **Never commit `.mcp.json`** with real API keys - it's in `.gitignore`
- Use **environment variables** for all credentials
- The `.mcp.json.example` file is safe to commit - it only contains `${VAR}` placeholders
- Each user configures their own credentials locally
